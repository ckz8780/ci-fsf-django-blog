# Welcome! 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-blog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ckz8780/ci-fsf-django-blog)

This is a simple blog application built with Python and Django. It is continuously inegrated via Travis CI and demonstrates some of the core features of Django. This is part of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module for CodeInstitute.

This project uses Bootstrap 3, but Django 2.0, so some code (namely the `urls.py` syntax) has been updated from the base project. It has been launched on Heroku using a Postgres database, and uses a local sqlite3 DB for testing. 

A live version is at https://ci-fsf-django-blog.herokuapp.com - please be patient on initial load as this is a free dyno and may go to sleep!
